## Hello world, this is Sawyer's Lab! ðŸ‘‹

We are the [Breast Cancer Genetics Group](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/breast-cancer-genetics), a research group at the King's College London :school: and led by Professor Elinor Sawyer, a Clinical Oncologist. The group is based in the Innovation Hub in the Guys Cancer Centre, London :round_pushpin:. 

We study the molecular genetics of invasive lobular breast cancer and in situ breast cancer and the identification of biomarkers of progression to invasive disease. We also have a strong interest in genetic predisposition to these subtypes of breast cancer.

## Projects

- Prevent Ductal Carcinoma in Situ Invasive Overtreatment Now â€“ [**PRECISION**](https://www.dcisprecision.org/). In order to reduce the overtreatment of pre-cancerous conditions that do not progress to invasive disease, the Breast Cancer Genetics group are looking at cohort of patients who have had Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the past in the hopes of identifying any markers that can help in predicting the recurrence or progression from DCIS to invasive cancer.

## Packages

- [Breakclone](https://github.com/Sawyer-s-Group/breakclone) is an R package for assessing clonal relationships of tumour pairs based on copy number or mutation data.
